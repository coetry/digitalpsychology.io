Triggers are anything that cues us to complete a particular action. They tell us what to do next and come in the form of internal and external triggers.

External triggers are all around us. They target our senses and remind us to take a particular action. It can be something obvious like a "Click here" button but also something like a delicious smell of fresh coffee and cake, while you're walking down the street.

Internal triggers, on the other hand, are impulses which come from within us. Memories, emotions or situations provide the information for what to do next. For example, the fear of losing out a moment triggers some people to take a photo and post it on Instagram. Internal triggers are a major factor for building habit-forming products and are the drivers for the growth of billion dollar companies.
