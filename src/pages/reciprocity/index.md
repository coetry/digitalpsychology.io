*“You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.”* Zig Ziglar


We feel a sense of obligation to return favors to people who have done something for us. This rule works not only with people you know but also with strangers. It's a human characteristic that allows us to live as a society. ([Gouldner, 1960](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2092623?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents))


## Studies

In an experiment, subject thought they were evaluating art. Also in the room was a fellow participant, who was in reality a research assistant. In one condition, the assistant would leave the room and bring back two cans of Coke – for him and the subject. In another condition, he would return empty-handed. At the end of the experiment, the assistant asked the participants if they would buy a raffle ticket from him. As expected, the subjects who had received the gift were twice more likely to purchase tickets, even though the tickets were far more expensive than the can of soda had been. ([Regan, 1971](http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/effects_of_a_favor_and_liking_on_compliance.pdf))

Reciprocity outperforms reward as a principle of persuasion when it comes to collecting correct contact information from a user. Asking for contact details, which would unlock a link to a whitepaper (reward) generated slightly more entries, but most of them invalid, whereas providing the whitepaper for free and then asking for contact information for further news (reciprocity), led to less, but overall more valid entries. ([Gamberini, Petrucci, Spoto & Spagnolli, 2007](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-77006-0_24))

Even very inexpensive meals (< $20) sponsored by pharmaceutical firms led to an increase in physician prescriptions of the promoted brand-name medication. ([DeJong et al.,  2016](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2528290))


## Examples


### Guest blogging
Write unique and high-quality posts for other blogs, of which they can be proud. To give back, they will more likely promote the content more vigorously or offer to write something on your blog in return. It's not unusual that an outstanding guest post results in a long-standing partnership.

### Gifts in social games
All gifting mechanisms in social games like FarmVille or Mafia Wars where a user can send in-game items to a friend rely on the principle of reciprocity. If I send you something won't you send me something back?

### Asking for app ratings
First and foremost: build a great app. Once that requirement is met, make sure that a positive experience exists before asking a user to rate your app e.g. after a booking, purchase or being a loyal user for several days.

### 10x content marketing
Give away value in the form of free kick-ass blog posts, webinars, ebooks, whitepapers, videos, mini-applications and so on. People got used to receiving mediocre freebies, and you're expected to give everything away nowadays. It's rarely perceived as a favor. Create something that is ten times better than the best result you can find on your topic. When your content enables someone to yield results, they are more likely to give it back by sharing it or even becoming a paying customer. What about asking first to enter an email address before accessing the content? No, not a reciprocity-invoking tactic.

### Show your face in cold emails
In a study, subjects were requested to fill out a survey, which they received by email. Attaching a sender's photograph at the end of the email increased the compliance rate ([Guéguen & Jacob, 2004](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/109493102753770525)). That's exactly what Stephen Twomey did in [an experiment](https://justreachout.io/blog/howto-increase-response-rate-email-pitch/) where he pitched his guest posts. He increased the response rate with this technique by 333.33%.

### Break your anonymity and build trust
Use the same principle in other areas to increase the likelihood of reciprocity: add an author box to each blog post, show the faces behind your brand on your social media accounts or create an "About Us" page for your product. Trust and reciprocity often go hand in hand ([Berg, Dickhaut & McCabe, 1995](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825685710275)).

### Free coaching sessions
This act works like the previously mentioned content marketing freebies, but instead of being anonymous the attendee has to put away his anonymity. A study shows that people who received a favor and were required to put their contact information on a pledge card were more likely to comply with the donation request ([Whatley, Webster, Smith & Rhodes, 1999](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247808309_The_Effect_of_a_Favor_on_Public_and_Private_Compliance_How_Internalized_is_the_Norm_of_Reciprocity)).
