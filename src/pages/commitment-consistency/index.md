We are driven to be consistent in all areas of life. When we make a promise, we feel obligated to fulfill. When we make a decision, have an opinion or act in a particular manner, we strive to make all future behaviors match the past actions and decisions. We tend to justify these commitments by seeking confirmation and providing reasons for supporting them.


## Studies

Everyone knows or was even a part of projects where costs exploded by many times. Sometimes managers and even entire organizations seem almost programmed to follow a direction which is doomed to failure. **Escalation of commitment** refers to the tendency to stay with a decision and to dedicate additional effort, money and time into a course of action that is failing. We don't want to lose the resources already invested and don't want to appear inconsistent. ([Staw, 1976](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&rep=rep1&type=pdf))

"I will keep reading this book that I'm 100 pages into although I don't really like it." Sounds familiar? Sure, you spent the money on the book and your time already but you can’t get it back. This distortion of our decisions by emotional investments is called the **sunk cost fallacy**.  It leads us to continue a behavior as a result of previously invested resources. ([Arkes & Blumer, 1985](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.452.2318&rep=rep1&type=pdf))

The **Ikea effect** is a cognitive bias in which we disproportionately value things more if we put work in them. This phenomenon has a range of possible explanations: A successful completion of a task gives us the feeling of competence and puts us in a positive mood. Another reason could be that we like to justify the efforts that we've invested in a product, so we tend to like it more. ([Norton, Mochon, & Ariely, 2012](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41121))

People use the current situation as a reference point, and any change from that is perceived as a loss. We prefer familiarity and tend to resist change. This phenomenon is known as the **status quo bias**. ([Samuelson & Zeckhauser, 1988](https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rzeckhau/SQBDM.pdf))
