Everybody likes rewards and appreciation. A shot of dopamine gets released and mediates pleasure in the brain. The increase in dopamine level also encourages our brain to remember the prior action so that we can repeat it to get the reward again. In other words: rewards make us come back for more.

We distinguish between fixed and variable rewards. The first type is straight forward: we know excatly what to do to get rewarded. Every time the goal is reached we earn something. On the other hand, variable rewards are unpredictable and foster curiosity.

## Studies

If we're unsure when we get a "treat," we continue to act – just in case. This phenomenon is known as the *partial reinforcement effect*. Even if the reward entirely disappears, this behavioral pattern will continue for a while because we don't know if it's just a longer pause than usual before the next reward. Intermittently reinforced behavior is more persistent than behavior that is acknowledged each time it occurs. So if you want consistent behavior don’t reward people every time they do something. ([Nevin, 1988](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247408514_Behavioral_Momentum_and_the_Partial_Reinforcement_Effect))

The continuation of the response during the condition where no reinforcers are given is called *resistance to extinction*. Researchers have found out that high-frequency gamblers show an increased resistance. It's open whether it's a cause or an effect of constant gambling. ([Horsley, Osborne, Norman & Wells, 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221774874_High-frequency_gamblers_show_increased_resistance_to_extinction_following_partial_reinforcement))

Researchers observed that rats respond more often with the desired behavior to press a lever when the rewards were random. Some lever presses succeeded in getting a food pellet, but most went unreinforced. ([Skinner & Ferster, 1957](https://books.google.ch/books?id=xctyCQAAQBAJ))
